# Computational-Physics
Collection of code for my 3rd year computational physics course.
[LinAlgEx1](https://github.com/hermiti-sam/Computational-Physics/blob/main/LinAlgEx1.ipynb)
First exercise of this module. Involved writing a short program to solve a specified system of equations for a physics problem. Full explanation of the problem is included in the notebook.

[LinAlgEx2](https://github.com/hermiti-sam/Computational-Physics/blob/main/LinAlgEx2.ipynb)
Second Exercise of this module. Involved writing a short program to solve eigenvalue problems related to the schrodinger equation.
